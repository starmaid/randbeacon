# randbeacon
a lights display that reads the values from NIST's Randomness Beacon

We are using the [NIST Randomness Beacon v2](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/interoperable-randomness-beacons/beacon-20) which generates truly random bitstrings once a minute. 

I think its cool that theres something in this world called a beacon.
